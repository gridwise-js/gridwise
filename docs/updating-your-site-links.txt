## The Crucial Next Step: Updating Your Site's Links ðŸ”—
Simply changing the _config.yml file is only half the battle. You must ensure your site's templates use these variables. If your links are hardcoded, they will break.

You need to go through your layout files (_layouts), includes (_includes), and any other HTML or Markdown files to make sure all internal links and asset paths are prepended with {{ site.baseurl }}.

Here are some examples of what to look for and how to fix them:

CSS Stylesheets:

Incorrect: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">

Correct: <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/style.css">

JavaScript Files:

Incorrect: <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>

Correct: <script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/main.js"></script>

Image Paths:

Incorrect: <img src="/images/logo.png">

Correct: <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png">

Internal Page Links:

Incorrect: <a href="/about/">About Us</a>

Correct: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">About Us</a>

By using {{ site.baseurl }}, you make your site portable. Jekyll will automatically insert /gridwise when building for your project site and an empty string if you ever move it back to an organization/user site.
